## Comments (to delete when slides done)

Currently I include a slide for each major point. Comments or things we should mention on each slide are in speaker notes: triple colons (:::) with a notes class ({.notes}).

## Rated R

![Stackoverflow 2022 Developer Survey](stackoverflow-survey-2022-screenshot.png)

::: notes
Zsuzsa:

People complain about R's syntax. As a general-purpose programming language, it has its flaws. But R shines in data analysis:

1.  `tidyverse` more popular than `pandas` : in Python terms, `pandas` is a good, but ultimately shallow copy of `tidyverse`
2.  Why is Stata not included? The survey, as today's debate, is about coding *languages* - not clicky-clicky tools. That is also why Stata is effectively disqualified from the debate: it is not a coding language.

R is great and beginner-friendly for data analysis (`tidyverse`, `ggplot`); Python is a close second; ; Stata, is not even a programming language, and exits the race at the starting line.

Marc: In summary...

Transition: "So Zsuzsa, let's look at some trends in data analysis (switch to the Shiny app)."

Python - there is one, and only one, way: copy R

``` {.python style="font-size: 0.8em; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto"}
# Warning: creates a shallow copy
pandas = tidyverse.copy()   
```

## Shiny Trends

::: notes
Zsuzsa:

If we are sure the web part works, we should not have this slide. Otherwise it should have a screenshot of Shiny. Potentially it could literally run the Shiny app, but I am not sure if it would work?

1.  Some comment about how Python and R are doing better
2.  Stata is (yet again) doing poorly - and predicted to continue doing poorly.

## Tidyverse

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
l1 <- list(a = "Test") # Include the relevant Shiny code here (basic pipe etc)
```

::: notes
Zsuzsa:

-   Explain the basics (not the functions, but the pipeline, that it is about relational data, coherent framework hence tidyVERSE). Mention the Kaggle stuff in passing as a way to say that a lot of code is in this area.

-   Highlight `ggplot2`, which was also copied in Python

-   Maybe: mention that a great way to learn about the tidyverse are the vignettes

-   At the end mention or highlight the functions and how it allows to abstract things

## Functions, Classes, and Abstraction

::: fragment
Programming languages (R and Python) have it all:
:::

::: incremental
-   Functions
-   Classes
-   Loops
-   Packages
-   ...
:::

::: notes
Marc:

-   R has abstractions for mature programming. Python, being a real programming language, does similarly.

-   What does Stata have?

-   Let's watch a running Stata program: .doh files (video or screenshot)
:::

## A fact-based, true run of Stata scripts

::: notes
Marc:

-   Video or screenshot of running Stata code with Homer Simpson's "D'oh"s

-   If you are a programmer, you can use makefiles for 'replicability'. Don't believe me? Look at Miklos Koren's well-documented Stata scripts (they are scripts, not code).

-   Hand over to Zsuzsa by saying "We should also say something positive about Stata."
:::

::: fragment
In other words: R is functional, and Stata disfunctional.
:::

## Our Favorite Stata Code

::: notes
Zsuzsa:

-   Show it as a transition to the final slide. Something like "Here is some Stata code that even I can get behind."
-   We can drop this slide if we have too much to cover
:::

```{stata}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

rsource, terminator(END_OF_R) rpath("/usr/local/bin/R") roptions(`"--vanilla"')
// rsource using my_script.R, rpath(`"c:\r\R-3.5.1\bin\Rterm.exe"') roptions(`"--vanilla"')  // use this line instead if you run a windows box

library(tidyverse);     # collection of all-around useful R packages
library(haven);         # for importing Stata datasets
library(dotwhisker);    # easy and beautiful regression plots, imho

# ZSUZSA: Replace by one of our code samples

END_OF_R
```

## Bright and Shiny

::: notes
Zsuzsa:

-   Show full code in Rstudio (not to explain, only to highlight)

-   Mention the link to play with (but only if we know that the app will work without cheating! Or else we'll get tough questions from the crowd).

Marc takes the quiz question.
